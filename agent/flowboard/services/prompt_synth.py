"""Auto-prompt synthesizer.

Given a target node, walks the immediate-upstream graph, collects
``aiBrief`` text from each parent node, and asks the configured
Auto-Prompt provider to compose a single image-generation prompt that
combines them. Used when the user clicks Generate without typing a
prompt.

Provider routing goes through ``run_llm("auto_prompt", ...)``. User picks
which one in Settings → AI Providers; default is Claude.

    "Those tokens are internal routing metadata, not final prompt text.\n\n"
    "POSE — every shot must look like a real editorial / lookbook photo:\n"
    "  • GAZE: the model's eyes MUST ENGAGE THE CAMERA — direct eye "
    "contact with the lens. No looking-away, no eyes-closed, no "
    "over-the-shoulder backshots, no profile-only poses. The face is "
    "always turned to camera.\n"
    "  • EXPRESSION — CRITICAL: NEUTRAL CLOSED-MOUTH expression at all "
    "times. NO smiling, NO teeth visible, NO laughing, NO open mouth. A "
    "very soft, almost-imperceptible curl of the lips is the maximum. "
    "This is non-negotiable — open-mouth smiles get warped by Veo i2v "
    "downstream and cause face-identity drift across the clip. Use "
    "phrases like 'composed neutral expression', 'closed-mouth confident "
    "look', 'lips together'.\n"
    "  • STANCE — pick ONE from this pool (rotate so generations stay "
    "diverse, do not repeat the same stance):\n"
    "    · both hands in pockets, weight on one leg, slight hip pop\n"
    "    · one hand brushing the collar / sleeve / hem of the garment\n"
    "    · hand-on-hip, body angled three-quarters to camera\n"
    "    · arms casually crossed at the chest, head tilted slightly\n"
    "    · hand running through hair, head turned slightly to the side\n"
    "    · one hand resting at the side of the face, playful or pensive\n"
    "    · walking towards camera mid-stride, casual confidence\n"
    "    · leaning weight on one hip with thumbs hooked into pockets\n"
    "  • BODY ANGLE: pick straight-on, three-quarter, or slight side — "
    "as long as the face stays toward camera.\n"
    "  • ATTITUDE: confident, charismatic, distinctive personality and "
    "presence (model 'aura'). Never stiff or generic.\n\n"
    "When a product / wardrobe asset is in the inputs AND no location "
    "reference is present, the chosen pose must make the GARMENT the "
    "visual hero — knees-up or full upper-body framing. When a location "
    "reference IS present, balance the framing: the garment stays "
    "readable but the environment must be visible in frame (wider shot, "
    "knees-up to full-body so the setting reads).\n\n"
    "Style: photoreal editorial fashion photography, sharp focus, soft "
    "even key light. BACKGROUND PRIORITY — if any reference image's "
    "brief describes an environment, location, or scene (e.g. 'park', "
    "'street', 'café', 'jogging path', 'interior room', 'beach'), USE "
    "that environment as the background of the shot: place the subject "
    "INTO that scene with matching natural light, perspective, and depth "
    "of field. Do NOT default to studio when a location reference exists "
    "in the inputs. Only fall back to a neutral indoor/studio background "
    "when zero location/scene references exist upstream. No marketing "
    "language, no preamble — output the prompt only."

    "right') so Flow can bind each person to the correct input image. "
    "NEVER replace `ref_image_N` with generic descriptors like 'an East "
    "Asian man'.\n"
    "  • ARRANGEMENT: side-by-side, slightly turned toward each other, or "
    "natural couple/group composition. Every subject must be fully "
    "visible — no one cropped or hidden behind another.\n"
    "  • POSE & GAZE rules apply to EACH subject — every face engages the "

    "  • COMPLEMENTARY STANCES: each subject picks a DIFFERENT gesture "
    "from the stance pool — never repeat the same stance across subjects.\n"
    "  • CONTACT: light natural couple-style contact is allowed (a hand "
    "on the other's shoulder, leaning slightly toward each other) but "
    "never invasive.\n"

# instead of rotating through canned gestures.
_SYNTH_VIDEO_CORE = (

    "VISION REFS — when reference images are attached, inspect the actual "
    "pixels and direct motion from visible facts in the source frame and "
    "role-bound refs. Never output raw role placeholder tokens such as "
    "character_ref, product_ref, outfit_ref, package_ref, background_ref, "
    "or style_ref. Those tokens are internal routing metadata, not final "
    "prompt text.\n\n"
    "INTENT FIRST. Look at the source: who is this person, what are "
    "they feeling, what would they naturally do in this moment? Let "
    "that drive the motion. The subject is a person with interiority, "
    "not a fashion model executing a pose pool.\n\n"
    "ANTI-FREEZE (safety floor only): Veo locks onto frame 0 if the "
    "prompt is too passive. SOMETHING visible must change between "
    "frame 0 and frame 8 — but it can be as small as a half-blink, a "
    "weight shift, a gaze drifting to the lens and back, or fabric "
    "catching a breeze. What fails is adjective-only direction "
    "without a concrete change attached: 'gentle softness' alone "
    "freezes; 'a slight weight shift, eyes settling on the lens' "
    "doesn't.\n\n"
    "PERFORMANCE notes — apply when they fit, ignore when they don't:\n"
    "  • Match the energy of the source. A poised studio portrait "
    "wants a held gaze with a tiny weight shift, not a runway pose "
    "change. A walking street shot wants forward momentum.\n"
    "  • Stillness is valid. A 6-second held moment with one small "
    "shift at the end can read more powerful than three beats of "
    "action stacked.\n"
    "  • Don't pile gestures. One real motion that carries weight "
    "beats three checklist gestures.\n"
    "  • Body language must read as in-character. The choice 'what "
    "does this person do next' should feel like THEIR choice, not the "
    "prompt-writer's.\n\n"
    "STRUCTURE is free. Use time-coded beats (e.g. 0-3s / 3-6s / 6-8s) "
    "when the scene calls for sequenced action. Use a single continuous "
    "direction when the scene calls for sustained presence. Pick what "
    "fits — don't default to either.\n\n"
    "ALWAYS include: natural blinks throughout, soft fabric and hair "
    "drift. These ground the clip without adding theatrical motion.\n\n"
    "AUDIO — Veo generates sound, and that audio passes a content "
    "filter (`PUBLIC_MIRROR_AUDIO_FILTER`) that REJECTS the entire "
    "request when speech is generated over faces resembling real "
    "people. Most Flowboard scenes are portraits, so steer the audio "
    "bed away from speech but DO include a gentle musical/ambient bed "
    "by default — pure silence reads sterile:\n"
    "  • NO SPEECH: no spoken dialogue, no voice-over, no lip-sync, "
    "no singing, no humming, no whispering. Mouths stay neutral "
    "closed-mouth.\n"
    "  • BACKGROUND MUSIC (default ON): a soft, gentle musical bed at "
    "low volume — lo-fi, ambient pad, mellow piano, soft acoustic "
    "guitar, light strings, calm cinematic underscore. Pick a mood "
    "that fits the scene (cozy / romantic / contemplative / serene). "
    "Keep it instrumental — no lyrics, no recognisable melody, no "
    "high-energy drops.\n"
    "  • SFX (light layer over the music): subtle diegetic ambient "
    "cues that match the setting (room tone, fabric rustle, light "
    "footsteps, soft breeze, distant city hum). Keep them quiet — "
    "they sit under the music, not on top.\n"
    "  • EXCEPTION: only when the user prompt EXPLICITLY asks for "
    "dialogue or singing should the clip include speech, and even "
    "then keep the audio direction generic (no specific accent / "
    "voice characteristic / impersonation) to keep filter risk low.\n\n"
    "No scene cuts, no text overlays. Max 400 chars. Output the "
    "motion prompt only — no preamble."
