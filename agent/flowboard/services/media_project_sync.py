"""Cross-project media re-upload + cache.

Flow scopes mediaIds to the project they were uploaded in. When a
request needs a reference image (gen_image refs, edit_image refs,
gen_video_omni ingredients) that was originally generated/uploaded
under another project, Flow returns 404 "Requested entity was not
found" because it can't see the asset in the current project.

This service bridges that gap: given an original_media_id + a target
project_id, return a media_id that Flow accepts as a reference under
that project. Re-uploads the local cached bytes on cache miss, records
the mapping in MediaProjectMapping so subsequent dispatches are
instant.

Cache semantics:
  - The mapping is keyed on (original_media_id, project_id). The same
    bytes can have multiple entries — one per project the user has
    dispatched against.
  - Identity mapping (original == project-local) is recorded too, so
    in-project refs short-circuit without a lookup miss.
  - Mapping is permanent for the lifetime of the database. If Flow
    eventually GCs a project's assets, the cache becomes stale; a
    dispatch failure surfaces and the operator can clear the row.
